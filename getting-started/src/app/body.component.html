        International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is an American multinational technology corporation
        headquartered in Armonk, New York, with operations in over 171 countries. The company began in 1911, founded in
        Endicott, New York by trust businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company
        (CTR) and was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924. IBM is incorporated in New York.[7]

        IBM produces and sells computer hardware, middleware and software, and provides hosting and consulting services
        in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. IBM is also a major research organization, holding
        the record for most annual U.S. patents generated by a business (as of 2020) for 28 consecutive years.[8]
        Inventions by IBM include the automated teller machine (ATM), the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic
        stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, the UPC barcode, and dynamic random-access
        memory (DRAM). The IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360, was the dominant computing platform during the
        1960s and 1970s.

        IBM has continually shifted business operations aimed at focusing on higher-value, more profitable markets. This
        includes spinning off printer manufacturer Lexmark in 1991 and the sale of personal computer
        (ThinkPad/ThinkCentre) and x86-based server businesses to Lenovo (in 2005 and 2014, respectively), and acquiring
        companies such as PwC Consulting (2002), SPSS (2009), The Weather Company (2016), and Red Hat (2019). In 2015,
        IBM announced that it would go "fabless", continuing to design semiconductors, but offloading manufacturing to
        GlobalFoundries, and in 2020, the company announced the spin-off of the Managed Infrastructure Services unit of
        its Global Technology Services division, with expected completion by the end of 2021.
